# Due Date

Finishing your MVP (Minimum Viable Product) as early as possible before iterating new features upon the project is highly recommended. Plan ahead, and be sure to reach out to others when you need guidance (or offer your own to those in need). You are REQUIRED to be able to explain your project functionality and write your own code, but feel free to have in-depth discussions with others.

# Git Help
For this project, we only need basic Git and GitHub usage. You should do these steps once, to set up:

## Make a Github Account
- Create a private repository (make sure to add your trainer as a contributor)
- Use the ```git clone command``` on your local machine to clone the repository to your local machine
- You should run the following commands frequently, while working on your project, in your git repo:

git status (just to see what has changed)
git add .
git commit -m "a message describing the work you've done goes here"
git push

If you receive an error message that you aren't in a git repo, cd to your cloned git repository on your local machine.
